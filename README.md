#  Humidity Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting humidity levels using a Linear Regression model. 
The workflow includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Preprocessing, Model Training, Evaluation, and Conclusion.  
It demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using Python and Scikit-learn.

## Dataset
The dataset contains environmental variables such as temperature and other related features used to predict humidity.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for missing values  
- Generated summary statistics  
- Visualized relationships using scatter plots  
- Identified patterns and correlations  

---

## Data Preprocessing
- Removed missing values  
- Defined features (X) and target variable (y)  
- Performed Train-Test Split (80-20 split)  

---

## Model Training
- Implemented Linear Regression  
- Trained model using training dataset  
- Generated predictions on test data  

---

## Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn
